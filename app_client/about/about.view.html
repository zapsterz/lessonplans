	<h2>The idea</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>So here's the thing. We have a national curriculum. That's right, it's <b>NATIONAL</b>.</p>
	<p>So therefore - we should have national lesson plans right? Yes? No. Not at the moment anyway, and <b>that's the dream.</b></p>
	<p>We aim to provide fully approved, fully editable plans + schemes of work, for every year group, and everything on the national curriculum.</p>
	<p>Sound a big idea? <b>We hope so.</b> If we get it right, we'll change teaching as we know it.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Progress so far</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Hmm, yeah. So right now not a lot of progress really.</p>
	<p>But there are big plans. Yep, <b>BIG PLANS.</b> Here are some of them:</p> 
	<!--<p>Here are some of them: </p>-->
	<p class="boldtext"><b>1. Get the Government on board</b></p>
	<p>This is essential, as we want Offstead on board. Yep, love them or hate them, we NEED them. </p>
	<p><b>2. Get the schemes of work</b></p>
	<p>These can then be reviewed by Offstead. We want every single thing on this site to have an Offstead rating.</p>
	<p>This gives us credibility, and more importantly, <b>trust.</b></p>
	<p>When you download a plan from this site, we want you to know that it's been reviewed, approved, and is ready-to-go.</p>
